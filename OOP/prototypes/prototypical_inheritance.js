// implement inheritance only using objects 

// 2 objects with one of them having all the common methods : PROTOTYPE

// prototype is the PARENT of another object 

// when we access a property or a method, JS engine looks first for the property or method in the object itself

// if it can't find it then it looks for a PROTOTYPE for that object 

// the root object is OBJECT BASE and the JS engine will look there for methods also if it can't find it anywhere in the children

// this is PROTOTYPICAL INHERITANCE

// every object has a prototype (or a parent) except for the root object
